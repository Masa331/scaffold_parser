# ScaffoldParser

Hi everybody,

the purpose of this gem is to take a XSD and generate parser and builder classes to work with XMLs it defines. Unfortunattely i didn't yet have a time to write the docs.

But it works! I already have a 2 gems generated and working with it:

* [pohoda](https://github.com/Masa331/pohoda)
* [moneys3](https://github.com/Masa331/moneys3)

If you really want to spend time finding out what this gem really does, you can try to look at the first linked repo above, it has some docs. Then if you think you would use something like this let me know and i will try to help. In the meantime, i will try to find some time to write the docs.
